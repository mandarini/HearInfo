    <h4>Behavioural Tips</h4>
    </br>
    <p> <small>
   • Be open: tell the person you’re speaking to that you have a hearing loss.
   </br></br>
	• Ask people to get your attention before they start talking to you.
	</br></br>
	• Get a better view: stand a reasonable distance from the person so you can see their face and lips. Gestures and facial expressions will help you understand what they’re saying. </br></br>
	• If necessary, ask people to slow down and speak more clearly.
	</br></br>
	• If you don’t catch what someone says, just ask them to say it again or in a different way.</br> </br>
	• Keep calm: if you get anxious, you might find it harder to follow what’s being said.
	</br></br>
	• Play to your strengths: if your hearing is better in one ear, try turning that side towards the person speaking to you.
	</br></br>
	• Learn to lipread: everyone does it a bit, especially
in noisy places. </br></br>
	• Be kind to yourself! No one hears correctly all the time.
